# Delhi metro operations optimization
## Description
This project involves a comprehensive data analysis of the Delhi Metro system. The primary purpose is to understand the geographical distribution, trip frequencies, and temporal patterns of metro usage. The objectives include identifying key trends, optimizing metro operations, and providing insights for future improvements.
## Objectives
* Analyze the geographical routes and station    distribution.
* Examine trip frequencies across different times of the day and days of the week.
* Identify patterns and trends in metro usage.
  Provide actionable insights for optimizing  metro operations.
## Background
The Delhi Metro is a rapid transit system serving Delhi and its satellite cities. It is one of the largest and busiest metro networks in India. Understanding its usage patterns can help in improving service efficiency and planning future expansions.
## Data Description
## Data Source
The data used in this project is sourced from the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC). The datasets include information on metro routes, stops, trips, and schedules.
## Data Format
The data is provided in CSV format, with the following key files:
* 'agency.txt'
* 'routes.txt'
* 'calendar.txt'
* 'shapes.txt'
* 'stop_times.txt'
* 'stops.txt'
* 'trips.txt'
## Data Structure
* 'agency.txt': Contains information about the metro agency.
* 'routes.txt': Details of different metro routes.
* 'calendar.txt': Service calendar indicating the days of operation.
* 'shapes.txt': Geographical coordinates of the metro routes.
* 'stop_times.txt': Schedule of stops for each trip.
* 'stops.txt': Information about metro stops.
* 'trips.txt': Details of individual trips.
## Important Variables
* 'shape_pt_lon' and 'shape_pt_lat': Longitude and latitude of metro routes.
* 'shape_id': Unique identifier for each route shape.
* 'arrival_time' and 'departure_time': Schedule times for stops.
* 'trip_id': Unique identifier for each trip.
* 'service_id': Identifier for service days.
## Methodology
## Data Analysis Techniques
* Data Cleaning: Handling missing values, correcting data types, and ensuring data consistency.
* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizing geographical routes, station distribution, and trip frequencies.
* Statistical Analysis: Analyzing trip patterns across different days and times.
* Feature Engineering: Creating new features like time intervals and parts of the day for deeper insights.
## Data Processing Steps
* Reading Data: Importing necessary libraries and reading the data files.
* Merging Data: Combining different datasets for comprehensive analysis.
* Visualization: Using scatter plots, bar plots, and other visual tools to represent data insights.
* Analysis: Identifying key trends and patterns in metro usage.
## Key Findings
* Comprehensive Coverage: The Delhi Metro system extensively covers the city, ensuring wide accessibility.
* High Network Density: Central and northern areas have a dense network of metro lines.
* Hub-and-Spoke Model: Metro lines radiate from central hubs to peripheral areas.
* Weekday Dominance: Higher transit usage on weekdays compared to weekends.
* Morning Sluggishness and Evening Activity Spike: Longer intervals in the morning and shorter intervals in the evening.
## Installation and Setup
### Prerequisites
**Python**: Version 3.6 or higher.
**Libraries**: pandas, numpy, seaborn, matplotlib.
## Setup Instructions
#### 1. Clone the repository:
        git clone https://github.com/yourusername/delhi-metro-analysis.git
        cd delhi-metro-analysis
#### 2. Create a virtual environment and activate it:
        python -m venv venv source venv/bin/activate 
        # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
#### 3. Install the required libraries:
        pip install -r requirements.txt
## Usage and Examples
### Running the Analysis
Ensure all data files are in the' data' directory.
Run the main analysis script:

        python main_analysis.py
## Sample Code

        import pandas as pd
        import seaborn as sns
        import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

        # Load data
        stops = pd.read_csv('data/stops.txt')

        # Plot stops distribution
        plt.figure(figsize=(10, 8))
        sns.scatterplot(x='stop_lon', y='stop_lat', data=stops, color='red', s=30)
        plt.title('Stops of Delhi Metro Stations')
        plt.xlabel('Longitude')
        plt.ylabel('Latitude')
        plt.show()
## Example Output
* Geographical Paths of Delhi Metro: Scatter plot showing the routes.
* Trips per Day of Week: Bar plot showing the number of trips from Monday to Sunday.
* Average Interval Between Trips by Part of Day: Bar plot showing average intervals.
